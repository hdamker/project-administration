## Release Information Sync

This PR updates the Release Information section in README.md to reflect the latest public release information from the CAMARA project administration data.

### What Changed

The Release Information section has been automatically updated to reflect the latest public release (**[{{latest_public_release}}]({{github_url}})**) with current API versions and links to documentation viewers
in a harmonized way across all API Repositories in Fall25.

### Instructions for Code Owners

**IMPORTANT:** This PR modifies content within automated delimiters in your README.md file:
```
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:START -->
...content managed automatically...
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:END -->
```

#### Content Preservation

**If you have custom content** in the Release Information section that should be preserved:
1. **Before merging this PR:** Move your custom content OUTSIDE the delimiter markers
2. Place it either after `<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:END -->` within the "## Release Information" section or in an additional section with the heading "## Additional Information"
3. Content inside the delimiters will be replaced on every campaign run

#### Review Checklist

- [ ] Verify the release information is accurate
- [ ] Check that API names and versions are correct
- [ ] Confirm all documentation links work
- [ ] Move any custom content outside delimiters (if needed)
- [ ] Verify the section heading remains "## Release Information"
