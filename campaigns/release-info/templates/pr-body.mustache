## Release Information Sync

This PR updates the Release Information section in README.md to reflect the latest public release information from the CAMARA project administration data.

### What Changed

The Release Information section has been automatically updated to reflect the latest public release (**[{{latest_public_release}}]({{github_url}})**) with current API versions and links to documentation viewers
in a harmonized way across all API Repositories.

### Instructions for Code Owners

**IMPORTANT:** This PR modifies content within automated delimiters in your README.md file:
```
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:START -->
...content managed automatically...
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:END -->
```

#### Content Preservation

**If you have custom content** in the Release Information section that should be preserved:
1. **Before merging this PR:** Move your custom content OUTSIDE the delimiter markers
2. Place it either after `<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:END -->` within the "## Release Information" section or in an additional section with the heading "## Additional Information"
3. Content inside the delimiters will be replaced on every campaign run

#### Review Checklist

**Review Focus:** Verify delimiter placement and section structure only.

**Content Validation Not Required:** Release versions, dates, API names, and documentation links are automatically synchronized from [releases-master.yaml](https://github.com/camaraproject/project-administration/blob/main/data/releases-master.yaml) and maintained by Release Management.

- [ ] Verify delimiters are correctly placed (wrapping entire "## Release Information" section)
- [ ] Confirm section heading remains "## Release Information"
- [ ] Move any custom content outside delimiters (if needed)
- [ ] Check that the automated content does not conflict with other README sections
