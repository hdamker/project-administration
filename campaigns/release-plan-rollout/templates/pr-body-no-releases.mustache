## Add release-plan.yaml for automated release tracking

**TL;DR:** This PR adds `release-plan.yaml` for **automated release tracking (replacing manual API Release Tracker pages on wiki)**.

> **Note:** Adding `release-plan.yaml` is a prerequisite for the upcoming release automation process.
> This PR does **not** yet enable the automated release workflow; onboarding will follow separately.

### What is this?

The `release-plan.yaml` file declares your release plan for this repository **and its APIs**. It enables:
- **Automated release tracking** (replacing manual API Release Tracker pages on wiki)
- **CI validation** of release readiness
- Automated release preparation (enabled during onboarding)

### Pre-populated data

- **Contacts:** from your CODEOWNERS file
- **APIs:** an initial placeholder entry is provided (even if API definition files already exist)

:point_right: **Please review and adjust** if API-specific contacts differ from repository-wide codeowners.

### Placeholder API entry (before your first release)

For repositories without prior releases, the generated `release-plan.yaml` contains a **placeholder API entry**.

- If you already know the final API name(s), please replace the placeholder now.
- If the API name is not decided yet (e.g. community discussion ongoing), you may keep the placeholder **as long as** `target_api_status: draft`.

:point_right: **Before planning a release** (set `target_release_type` to a non-`none` value) **or** changing the API status above `draft`, you must replace the placeholder with the final API name(s).

### What to do next

**Option A: Merge as-is** (if no release planned yet)
- Keep `target_release_type: none`
- Keep APIs at `target_api_status: draft`
- You can update names and add additional API entries later (recommended once naming is settled)

**Option B: Update before merging** (if you already know your API name(s))
1. Replace `placeholder-entry` with your intended API name(s) (kebab-case, per Commonalities naming guidelines)
2. Keep `target_api_status: draft` unless you are ready to declare `alpha` or `rc`
3. Review `main_contacts` (pre-populated from CODEOWNERS)

### When ready to release

1. Ensure API names in `release-plan.yaml` match your files in `code/API_definitions/`
2. Update `target_api_status` from `draft` to `alpha` or `rc` (depending on your first release target)
3. Set `target_release_type` (e.g. `pre-release-alpha`)

<summary><b>API status and release type meanings</b></summary>

### target_api_status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `draft` | API declared, definition file not required yet |
| `alpha` | API definition exists, ready for early feedback |
| `rc` | Release candidate, feature-complete |
| `public` | Public release |

### target_release_type

| Value | When to use |
|---|---|
| `none` | No release currently planned |
| `pre-release-alpha` | Early, incomplete preview release for feedback |
| `pre-release-rc` | Release candidate publication |
| `public-release` | Public CAMARA release |
| `maintenance-release` | Patch/maintenance release in an existing cycle |
