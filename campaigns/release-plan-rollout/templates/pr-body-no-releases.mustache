## Add release-plan.yaml for automated release tracking

This PR introduces `release-plan.yaml` -- a metadata file that enables automated release tooling for your repository.

### What is this?

The `release-plan.yaml` file declares your release intentions. It enables:
- **Automated Release Progress Tracker** (visibility across CAMARA)
- **CI validation** of release readiness
- **Automated release branch creation** (coming soon)

> **Note:** Adding `release-plan.yaml` is a prerequisite for the planned release automation. This does not yet enable the automated release workflow -- onboarding will follow separately.

### Pre-populated data

- **Contacts**: From your CODEOWNERS file

:point_right: **Please review and adjust** if API-specific contacts differ from repository-wide codeowners.

### What to do now

**Option A: Merge as-is** (if you don't have an API name defined yet)
- The file contains a `placeholder-entry` -- replace it when planning a release
- `target_release_type: none` means "no release currently planned"
- You can add API definitions freely -- validation applies when preparing a release

**Option B: Update before merging** (recommended if you have an API name)
1. Replace `placeholder-entry` with your intended API name (kebab-case, per [Commonalities naming guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities))
2. Keep `target_api_status: draft` -- the API definition file doesn't need to exist yet
3. Review `main_contacts` -- pre-populated from CODEOWNERS

The API name can still be changed before your first release if needed.

### When ready to release

1. Ensure API names in this file match your files in `code/API_definitions/`
2. Update `target_api_status` from `draft` to `alpha` (or higher)
3. Set `target_release_type: pre-release-alpha`

### API status progression

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | API declared, definition file not required yet |
| `alpha` | API definition exists, ready for early feedback |
| `rc` | Release candidate, feature-complete |
| `public` | Public release |
