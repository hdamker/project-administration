## Add release-plan.yaml for automated release tracking

**TL;DR:** This PR adds `release-plan.yaml` for **automated release tracking (replacing manual API Release Tracker pages on wiki)**.

> **Note:** Adding `release-plan.yaml` is a prerequisite for the upcoming release automation process.
> This PR does **not** yet enable the automated release workflow; onboarding will follow separately.

### What is this?

The `release-plan.yaml` file declares your release plan for this repository **and its APIs**. It enables:
- **Automated release tracking** (replacing manual API Release Tracker pages on wiki)
- **CI validation** of release readiness
- Automated release preparation (enabled during onboarding)

### Pre-populated data

The `release-plan.yaml` file is generated from your **current release data** and repository settings:
- **Release tag:** `target_release_tag` is set to {{target_release_tag}} (detected from your current release)
- **APIs:** derived from your current release ({{target_release_tag}})
- **Contacts:** from your CODEOWNERS file

:point_right: **Please review and adjust** if API-specific contacts differ from repository-wide codeowners.

### What to do next

**Option A: Merge as-is** (if no release planned yet)
- The file reflects your current release state ({{target_release_tag}}{{#meta_release}}, {{meta_release}}{{/meta_release}})
- `target_release_type: none` means "no release currently planned"
- Just merge

**Option B: Update before merging** (if planning your next release now)
1. Set `target_release_type` (e.g. `pre-release-alpha` or `pre-release-rc`)
2. Update `target_release_tag` for your next release:
   - New cycle: increment first number, reset second to 1 (e.g., r3.2 → r4.1)
   - Progression in same cycle: increment second number (e.g., r3.2 → r3.3)
3. Update `target_api_version` for any APIs being changed
4. Optionally add `meta_release: Sync26` if participating in the meta-release
