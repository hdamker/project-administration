## Add release-plan.yaml for automated release tracking

This PR introduces `release-plan.yaml` -- a metadata file that will replace manual wiki-based release tracking with automated tooling.

### What is this?

The `release-plan.yaml` file declares your release intentions for this repository. It enables:
- **Automated Release Progress Tracker** (replacing wiki API tables)
- **CI validation** of release readiness
- **Automated release branch creation** (coming soon)

> **Note:** Adding `release-plan.yaml` is a prerequisite for the planned release automation. This does not yet enable the automated release workflow -- onboarding will follow separately.

### Pre-populated data

This file was generated from your latest release data and repository settings:
- **Release tag**: `target_release_tag` is set to {{target_release_tag}} (your latest release)
- **APIs**: From your most recent release ({{target_release_tag}})
- **Contacts**: From your CODEOWNERS file

You only need to change `target_release_tag` when you actively plan your next release.

:point_right: **Please review and adjust** if API-specific contacts differ from repository-wide codeowners.

### What to do now

**Option A: Merge as-is** (recommended if no immediate release planned)
- The file is pre-populated with your current release state ({{target_release_tag}}{{#meta_release}}, {{meta_release}}{{/meta_release}})
- `target_release_type: none` means "no release currently planned"
- Just merge -- the file will be updated when you plan your next release

**Option B: Update before merging** (if planning a release soon)
1. Set `target_release_type` to your intended release type
2. Update `target_release_tag` for your next release:
   - New cycle: increment first number, reset second to 1 (e.g., r3.2 -> r4.1)
   - Progression in same cycle: increment second number (e.g., r3.2 -> r3.3)
3. Update `target_api_version` for any APIs being changed
4. Optionally add `meta_release: Fall26` if participating in the meta-release

### Before your next release

Update this file with your release intentions:
```yaml
repository:
  target_release_tag: rX.Y      # Your next release tag
  target_release_type: pre-release-alpha  # Or: pre-release-rc, public-release, maintenance-release
```
