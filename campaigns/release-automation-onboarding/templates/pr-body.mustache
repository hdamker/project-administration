## Enable release automation for {{name}}

**TL;DR:** This PR adds the **release automation workflow** and prepares the CHANGELOG structure for **{{name}}**.

> **Note:** Once merged, the release automation becomes active.
> A Release Issue will be created automatically (if not existing yet) when `release-plan.yaml` is updated on `main`.

### What is this?

The release automation workflow enables slash commands on **Release Issues** to manage your release lifecycle. Post these as comments on the Release Issue:
- `/create-snapshot` — create a snapshot branch (updates versions, changelog entries, and release metadata automatically)
- `/discard-snapshot <reason>` — discard a snapshot and return to planned state
- `/delete-draft` — delete a draft release
- `/publish-release --confirm rX.Y` — publish the release

### Changes

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.github/workflows/release-automation.yml` | Release automation workflow (pinned to `@{{caller_ref}}`) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | {{changelog_root_status}} |
| `CHANGELOG/README.md` | {{changelog_dir_status}} |

### What to do next

1. **Review** the file changes above
2. **Merge** this PR to activate the release automation

If `release-plan.yaml` was updated before this workflow was installed, you may need to **trigger the workflow manually once** to create the initial Release Issue:
- Go to **Actions → [Release Automation](https://github.com/{{org}}/{{name}}/actions/workflows/release-automation.yml) → Run workflow**

1. **Plan** — update `release-plan.yaml` with target release tag, type, and API versions/statuses
2. **Develop** — continue work on `main` branch with version fields set to `wip`
3. **Create Snapshot** — post `/create-snapshot` on the Release Issue to generate a Release PR
4. **Review & Merge** — review Release PR (includes CHANGELOG entry), obtain approvals, merge it
5. **Publish** — post `/publish-release --confirm rX.Y` to finalize the release

If issues arise: use `/discard-snapshot` (during review) or `/delete-draft` (during draft phase) to return to planned state and make corrections on `main`.
