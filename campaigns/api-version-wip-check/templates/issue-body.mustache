**Problem description**

The main branch of this repository contains API definitions and/or test files with version references that are not yet reset to `wip`. According to CAMARA guidelines, all version fields on the main branch must use work-in-progress (`wip`) versions after a release.

**Files to update:**

{{formatted_yaml_files}}

{{formatted_feature_files}}

**Expected action**

Codeowners should create a PR to update the affected files to use `wip` versions:
- Set `info.version` to `"wip"` in OpenAPI YAML files
- Set `servers[].url` to use `/vwip` path segment (e.g., `{apiRoot}/api-name/vwip`)
- Update Feature lines in test files to reference `vwip`
- Update resource URLs in test files to use `/vwip/` path segment

**Additional context**

This is standard post-release procedure. The main branch always stays in a work-in-progress state, with version fields only updated to specific versions on dedicated release branches. This prepares the repository for the next development cycle and aligns with the new CAMARA Release Workflow.
